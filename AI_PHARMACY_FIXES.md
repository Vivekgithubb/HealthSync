# AI Pharmacy Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Prescription Parsing (Gemini AI)
**Problem:** AI wasn't parsing prescriptions correctly or returning empty results.

**Solutions:**
- Improved AI prompt to be more specific and request valid JSON format
- Enhanced JSON parsing with regex fallback to extract array from response
- Added better error handling for malformed AI responses
- Filters out invalid medication names (too long or empty)
- Added validation to ensure response is an array
- Created uploads directory check with proper path handling
- Added file type validation and size limits (10MB)

### 2. Manual Drug Search (OpenFDA API)
**Problem:** Drug searches weren't returning results.

**Solutions:**
- Fixed OpenFDA query format to use proper OR syntax: `(openfda.brand_name:TERM OR openfda.generic_name:TERM)`
- Previous format used `+` which was treated as AND, limiting results
- Improved error messages to suggest trying different spellings or generic names
- Added detailed logging for debugging API responses

### 3. Error Handling
**Improvements:**
- Better error messages for users (API key issues, quota exceeded, drug not found)
- Console logging of full error details for debugging
- Specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Frontend displays full error messages from backend

## Testing

To test the OpenFDA API independently, run:
```bash
cd backend
node test-fda.js
```

This will test common drug names and show which queries work.

## Backend Restart Required

After these changes, restart the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

## Common Drug Names to Test

For **Manual Search**, try these (should work now):
- aspirin
- ibuprofen
- tylenol
- acetaminophen
- lipitor
- atorvastatin

For **AI Prescription Parsing**, upload a clear image of:
- A printed prescription
- A prescription label
- A medication list

**Tips for better AI parsing:**
- Use clear, well-lit photos
- Ensure text is readable
- Avoid blurry or rotated images
- The AI works best with printed prescriptions

## Troubleshooting

If prescription parsing still fails:
1. Check backend console for Gemini AI errors
2. Verify GEMINI_API_KEY in `.env`
3. Check API quota at https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

If drug search fails:
1. Check backend console for OpenFDA errors
2. Try simpler drug names (generic names work better)
3. OpenFDA API has rate limits (240 requests/minute per IP)
