# Publishing HealthSync to GitHub

## 📝 Before You Push

### 1. Security Check ✅

Make sure these files are **NOT** included (check `.gitignore`):
- ❌ `backend/.env` (contains API keys)
- ❌ `backend/uploads/*` (uploaded files)
- ❌ `node_modules/` (dependencies)

✅ The `.gitignore` is already configured correctly!

### 2. Clean Up Sensitive Data

The `backend/.env` file contains your actual credentials. Before pushing:

**Option A: Use Environment Variables (Recommended for deployment)**
```bash
# On your production server, set these as environment variables
# No .env file needed in production
```

**Option B: Keep .env Local Only**
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`
- Users will need to create their own `.env` from `.env.example`
- This is the current setup ✅
