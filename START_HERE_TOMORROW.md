# Resume HealthSync Development - Quick Start

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✅ Complete backend API (all routes, models, controllers)
- ✅ Backend dependencies installed
- ✅ Frontend dependencies installed (axios, lucide-react)
- ✅ Style guide created
- ✅ All documentation files created

## 🚀 What to Do Tomorrow

### Step 1: Set Up Backend Environment Variables

Edit the file: `backend/.env`

**You need to get these API keys:**

1. **MongoDB** (Choose one):
   - Local: Install from mongodb.com/download
   - Cloud: Sign up at mongodb.com/atlas (Recommended - easier)

2. **Cloudinary** (For file uploads):
   - Sign up at cloudinary.com
   - Get: Cloud Name, API Key, API Secret

3. **Gemini AI** (For prescription parsing):
   - Get free API key at ai.google.dev

4. **Gmail** (Optional - for email reminders):
   - Use your Gmail + App Password

### Step 2: Test Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Should see:
- "MongoDB Connected"
- "Server running on port 5000"

### Step 3: Tell Warp You're Ready

Just say: **"I'm ready to build the frontend"**

I'll then create:
- Complete React frontend with all 7 pages
- Authentication system
- API integration
- HealthSync design system implementation
- All reusable components

## 📁 Important Files to Know

- `backend/.env` - Environment variables (YOU NEED TO FILL THIS)
- `backend/.env.example` - Template showing what you need
- `backend/README.md` - Complete API documentation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Full implementation status
- `HealthSync_Style_Guide.md` - Design specifications

## 💡 Quick Commands Reference

**Start Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Start Frontend:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Your Current Status

- Backend: 100% Complete ✅
- Frontend: 0% (Ready to build tomorrow)
- Next Task: Fill out `backend/.env` with API keys

---

**See you tomorrow! The project is all saved and ready to continue.** 🚀
